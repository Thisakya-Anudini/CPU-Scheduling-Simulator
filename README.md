# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Project Overview

This project is a **CPU Scheduling Simulator** that helps visualize and compare different scheduling algorithms in operating systems. The simulator allows users to input tasks with their arrival times, burst times, and priorities, and apply various algorithms to calculate waiting times, turnaround times, and execution schedules. The available algorithms include:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Shortest Job Next (SJN)**
- **Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)**
- **Priority Scheduling**

The results are displayed both numerically and visually using charts, making it easier to understand the performance of each algorithm.

## Features

- **Task Management:** 
  - Users can add and modify tasks, specifying arrival time, burst time, and priority.
  
- **Algorithm Selection:** 
  - Supports multiple scheduling algorithms (FCFS, Round Robin, SJN, SRTN, and Priority Scheduling).
  
- **Performance Visualization:** 
  - The simulator generates bar charts that compare average waiting time and turnaround time for each algorithm.
  
- **Execution Steps Display:** 
  - Detailed task execution steps are shown for each algorithm, with start and finish times for each task.
